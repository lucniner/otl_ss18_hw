Optimization in Transports and Logistics - TU Vienna - summer term 2018 - homework exercise

## Description

Some helper functions to solve the homework in optimization in transports and logistics in the summer term 2018 at TU vienna. The needed algorithms, solutions for the homework were done by hand (simply executing the steps from the provided lecture slides). The code outputs all distances and savings, copying them to an external file for lookup and combination should be enough. Feel free to adapt and make it more interactive/program the complete solution in java.
